DESCRIPTION
-----------------
This is a program that generates a space map of a given size and render only 
using ASCII.
Terrain is generated using perlin noise with relatively low octaves.

-----------------
USAGE
-----------------
Run the program. This will generate a random map of 30x30.

As of right now, there are no command line arguments to configure the map
generation (see LIMITATIONS).

-----------------
LIMITATIONS
-----------------
It is not possible to adjust the map size as of right now. This feature along 
with other (e.g. starting subprocesses to bulk test program, generating 
multiple maps at once and save it to a file) will be implemented soon.
